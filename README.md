# Clap-Switch
The clap switch is a simple electronics project
that demonstrates how sound signals (claps)
can be used to control an electrical device like
a bulb or LED

=> Purpose of a Clap Switch
The purpose of the clap switch experiment is to:
1. Convert sound energy (clap) into electrical signals.
2. Process the signals to trigger an electronic circuit.
3. Control an electrical device based on the processed
   signals.
# Required Components
1.Sound Module (Sound Sensor)
2. Arduino Nano Microcontroller
3. 5 Blue LEDs
4. Connecting wires
5. Breadboard
# Circuit Design
